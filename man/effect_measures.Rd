\title{Effect Measures
Calculates measures of effect: Odds Ratio (OR), Risk Ratio (RR),
Risk Reduction (RD) and either Number Needed to Treat (NNT) or
Number Needed to Harm (NNH).}
\usage{
effect_measures(data, alpha = 0.05, correction = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric, data.frame, table, or matrix
For vectors, values should be provided as c(a, b, c, d) where:
a = exposed with event, b = exposed without event,
c = unexposed with event, d = unexposed without event.
For matrices/tables/data.frames: rows represent exposure status
(exposed/unexposed), columns represent outcome (event/no event).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric.
Value between 0 and 1 specifying the alpha level for confidence intervals (CI).
Commonly used values are 0.05 (95\% CI), 0.01 (99\% CI), and 0.10 (90\% CI).
Default is 0.05.}

\item{correction}{Logical.
If TRUE, a continuity correction (0.5) is applied when any cell contains 0.
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{contingency_table}{2x2 contingency table with proper labels}
\item{odds_ratio}{Calculated odds ratio}
\item{or_ci}{Named vector with lower and upper bounds of OR confidence interval}
\item{risk_ratio}{Calculated risk ratio}
\item{rr_ci}{Named vector with lower and upper bounds of RR confidence interval}
\item{exposed_risk}{Risk in exposed group}
\item{unexposed_risk}{Risk in unexposed group}
\item{absolute_risk_diff}{Absolute risk difference}
\item{nnt_nnh}{Number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH)}
}
