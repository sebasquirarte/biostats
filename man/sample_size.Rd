\arguments{
\item{sample}{Character string. Whether one or two samples need to be calculated
("one-sample" or "two-sample").}

\item{design}{Character string. Study design when sample = "two-sample".
Options: "parallel" or "crossover". Default is NULL for one-sample tests.}

\item{outcome}{Character string. Type of outcome variable ("mean" or "proportion").}

\item{type}{Character string. Type of hypothesis test ("equality", "equivalence",
"non-inferiority", or "superiority").}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Type I error rate (significance level). Default is 0.05.}

\item{beta}{Numeric. Type II error rate (1 - power). Default is 0.20.}

\item{x1}{Numeric. Value of the mean or proportion for group 1 (treatment group).}

\item{x2}{Numeric. Value of the mean or proportion for group 2 (control group
or reference value).}

\item{SD}{Numeric. Standard deviation. Required for mean outcomes and crossover
designs with proportion outcomes. Default is NULL.}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Margin of clinical interest. Required for non-equality tests.
Must be negative for non-inferiority and positive for superiority/equivalence.
Default is NULL.}

\item{dropout_rate}{Numeric. Study discontinuation rate expected in the study. Default is 0.}

\item{k}{Numeric. Allocation ratio (n1/n2) for two-sample tests. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing:
\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size for group 1 (or total sample size for one-sample tests).}
\item{n2}{Integer. Sample size for group 2 (same as n for crossover designs).}
\item{total}{Integer. Total sample size across all groups.}
\item{sample}{Character string. Type of sampling method used ("one-sample" or "two-sample").}
\item{design}{Character string. Study design for two-sample tests, such as "parallel" or "crossover".}
\item{outcome}{Character string. Type of outcome variable ("mean" or "proportion").}
\item{type}{Character string. Type of hypothesis test ("equality", "equivalence", "non-inferiority", or "superiority").}
\item{alpha}{Numeric. Type I error rate (significance level).}
\item{beta}{Numeric. Type II error rate (1 - power).}
\item{x1}{Numeric. Value of the mean or proportion for group 1 (treatment group).}
\item{x2}{Numeric. Value of the mean or proportion for group 2 (control group or reference value).}
\item{SD}{Numeric. Standard deviation.}
\item{delta}{Numeric. Margin of clinical interest.}
\item{dropout_rate}{Numeric. Study discontinuation rate expected in the study.}
\item{k}{Numeric. Allocation ratio (n1/n2) for two-sample tests.}
\item{z_alpha}{Numeric. Z-score corresponding to the significance level alpha.}
\item{z_beta}{Numeric. Z-score corresponding to the Type II error rate beta.}
\item{zscore}{Numeric. Squared sum of z_alpha and z_beta, used for sample size calculation.}
