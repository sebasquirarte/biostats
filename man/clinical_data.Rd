\title{Simulate Simple Clinical Trial Data}
\usage{
clinical_data(
  n = 100,
  visits = 3,
  arms = c("Placebo", "Treatment"),
  dropout = 0,
  missing = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of subjects (1-999). Default is 100.}

\item{visits}{Integer. Number of visits including baseline. Default is 3.}

\item{arms}{Character vector. Treatment arm names. Default is c("Placebo", "Treatment").}

\item{dropout}{Numeric. Proportion of subjects who dropout (0-1). Default is 0.}

\item{missing}{Numeric. Overall proportion (0-1) of missing values to be introduced
across numeric variables qith fixed proportions (biomarker = 15\%, weight = 25\%,
response = 60\%). Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with columns: subject_id, visit, sex, treatment, age, weight,
biomarker, and response in long format.
}
\description{
Creates a simple simulated clinical trial dataset with subject demographics,
multiple visits, treatment groups with different effects, numerical and
categorical variables, as well as optional missing data and dropout rates.
}
\examples{
# Basic dataset
clinical_df <- clinical_data()

# Multiple treatment arms with dropout rate and missing data
clinical_df <- clinical_data(arms = c('Placebo', 'A', 'B'), missing = 0.05, dropout = 0.10)
