  n = 100,
  visits = 3,
  arms = c("Placebo", "Treatment"),
  dropout_rate = 0,
  na_rate = 0,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of subjects (1-999). Default is 100.}

\item{visits}{Integer. Number of visits including baseline. Default is 3.}

\item{arms}{Character vector. Treatment arm names. Default is c("Placebo", "Treatment").}

\item{dropout_rate}{Numeric. Proportion of subjects who dropout (0-1). Default is 0.}

\item{na_rate}{Numeric. Proportion of values missing at random (0-1). Default is 0.}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: subject_id, visit, sex, treatment, age,
weight, biomarker, and response. Data is in long format.
}
\description{
Creates a simulated clinical trial dataset with subject demographics,
multiple visits, treatment groups with different effects, numerical and
categorical variables, as well as optional missing data and dropout rates.
}
\examples{
# Basic dataset
clinical_df <- clinical_data()

# Multiple treatment arms with missing data
clinical_df <- clinical_data(arms = c("Placebo", "Low", "High"), na_rate = 0.05)
