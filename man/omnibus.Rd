\title{Tests for comparing three or more groups (omnibus)}
\usage{
omnibus(
  dependent_var = NULL,
  independent_var = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  paired_var = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  method = c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"),
  na.action = c("na.omit", "na.exclude", "na.pass", "na.fail")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dependent_var}{Character string. Name of the column containing the dependent variable data.}

\item{independent_var}{Character string. Name of the column containing the independent grouping variable.
Must have at least three unique groups.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing the variables.}

\item{paired_var}{Character string or NULL. Name of the column with the paired (within-subject) variable.
If provided, a repeated measures design is assumed.
The data should be organized by this variable in one of two common orders:
(A, B, C, A, B, C, ...) or (A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C).
If NULL, independent groups design is assumed.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for hypothesis tests. Default is 0.05.}

\item{method}{Character string. P-value adjustment method for multiple comparisons in post-hoc tests.
One of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", or "none".}

\item{na.action}{Character string. Action to take if NAs are present. One of "na.omit", "na.exclude", "na.pass", or "na.fail".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{formula}{The modelled formula used for the test.}
\item{summary}{Summary object of the model or test.}
\item{statistic}{Test statistic value (F or chi-squared).}
\item{p_value}{P-value observed in the omnibus test.}
\item{n_groups}{Number of groups in the independent variable.}
\item{significant}{Logical indicating whether the test was significant at the alpha level.}
\item{alpha}{Significance level used.}
\item{model}{The fitted model or test object.}
\item{data}{Input data frame.}
\item{post_hoc}{List of post-hoc test results if omnibus test was significant, otherwise NULL.}
\item{name}{Name of the test performed (e.g., "One-way ANOVA", "Kruskal-Wallis test", etc.).}
}
\description{
Omnibus tests evaluate overall effects in the given data. One-way ANOVA,
Repeated measures ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis test and Friedman test are included
in this term.
