\usage{
omnibus(
  y = NULL,
  x = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  paired_var = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  method = c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"),
  na.action = c("na.omit", "na.exclude")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Character string. Dependent variable (outcome).}

\item{x}{Character string. Independent variable (within-subject variable). Must have at least three unique levels.}

\item{data}{Dataframe containing the variables.}

\item{paired_var}{Character string or NULL. (source of repeated measurements).
If provided, a repeated measures design is assumed. Data should be in long format with
one row per observation. If NULL, independent groups design is assumed.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for hypothesis tests. Default is 0.05.}

\item{method}{Character string. p-value adjustment method for multiple comparisons in case of performing post-hoc pairwise (t or Wilcoxon) tests.
One of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", or "none".}

\item{na.action}{Character string. Action to take if NAs are present. Either "na.omit" or "na.exclude".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{formula}{The modelled formula used for the test.}
\item{summary}{Summary object of the model or test.}
\item{statistic}{Test statistic value (F or chi-squared).}
\item{p_value}{p-value observed in the omnibus test.}
\item{n_groups}{Number of groups in the independent variable.}
\item{significant}{Logical indicating whether the test was significant at the alpha level.}
\item{alpha}{Significance level used.}
\item{model}{The fitted model or test object.}
\item{data}{Input data frame.}
\item{post_hoc}{List of post-hoc test results if omnibus test was significant, otherwise NULL.}
\item{name}{Name of the test performed (e.g., "One-way ANOVA", "Kruskal-Wallis test", etc.).}
}
\description{
Performs omnibus tests to evaluate overall differences between three or more groups.
Automatically selects the appropriate statistical test based on data characteristics
and assumption testing. Supports both independent groups and repeated measures designs.
Tests include one-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and
Friedman test. Performs comprehensive assumption checking (normality, homogeneity
of variance, sphericity) and post-hoc testing when significant results
are detected.
