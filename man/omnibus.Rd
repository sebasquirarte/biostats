\title{Omnibus Tests for Comparing Three or More Groups}
\usage{
omnibus(
  data,
  y,
  x,
  paired_by = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  p_method = "holm",
  na.action = "na.omit"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe containing the variables to be analyzed. Data must be in long format
with one row per observation.}

\item{y}{Character string indicating the dependent variable (outcome).}

\item{x}{Character string indicating the independent variable (group or within-subject variable).}

\item{paired_by}{Character string indicating the source of repeated measurements. If
provided, a repeated measures design is assumed. If NULL, independent groups design is assumed.
Default: NULL.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value indicating the significance level for hypothesis tests. Default: 0.05.}

\item{p_method}{Character string indicating the method for p-value adjustment in post-hoc multiple
comparisons to control for Type I error inflation. Options: "holm" (Holm),
"hochberg" (Hochberg), "hommel" (Hommel), "bonferroni" (Bonferroni), "BH"
(Benjamini-Hochberg), "BY" (Benjamini-Yekutieli), "none" (no adjustment). Default: "holm".}

\item{na.action}{Character string indicating the action to take if NAs are present ("na.omit"
or "na.exclude"). Default: "na.omit"}
}
\value{
Prints results to console and invisibly returns a list including the formula, model,
statistic summary, name of the test performed, the value of the test statistic,
resulting p value and the results of the post_hoc test.
}
\description{
Performs omnibus tests to evaluate overall differences between three or more groups.
Automatically selects the appropriate statistical test based on data characteristics
and assumption testing. Supports both independent groups and repeated measures designs.
Tests include one-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and
Friedman test. Performs comprehensive assumption checking (normality, homogeneity
of variance, sphericity) and post-hoc testing when significant results are detected.

\examples{
# Simulated clinical data with multiple treatment arms and visits
clinical_df <- clinical_data(n = 300, visits = 6, arms = c("A", "B", "C"))

# Compare numerical variable across treatments
result <- omnibus(data = clinical_df,
                  y = "biomarker", 
                  x = "treatment")

# Compare numerical variable changes across visits 
result <- omnibus(y = "biomarker", 
                  x = "visit", 
                  data = clinical_df, 
                  paired_by = "subject_id")
