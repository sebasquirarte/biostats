\description{
Generates a summary table for biostatistics and clinical data analysis with
automatic normality, effect size, and statistical test calculations. Handles both
numeric and categorical variables, performing appropriate descriptive statistics
and inferential tests for single-group summaries or two-group comparisons.

\examples{
# Simulated clinical data
clinical_df <- clinical_data()

# Overall summary without considering treatment groups
summary_table(clinical_df,
              exclude = c('subject_id', 'visit'))

# Grouped summary by treatment group
summary_table(clinical_df,
              group_by = 'treatment',
              exclude = c('subject_id', 'visit'))

# Grouped summary by treatment group with all stats and effect size
summary_table(clinical_df,
              group_by = 'treatment',
              all = TRUE,
              effect_size = TRUE,
